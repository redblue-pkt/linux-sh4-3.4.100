 * STMicroelectronics NAND Flash STEM board
 *
 * Jumper Settings:
 *     J1 "CS Routing"
 *         1-2:    STEM_notCS0
 *         2-3:    STEM_notCS1 [1]
 *
 *     J2 "RBn Routing"
 *         Not used [2]
 *
 *     J3 "Write Protect"
 *         open:   unprotected
 *         closed: protected
 *
 *     CN2
 *         Do Not Fit
 *
 * Notes:
 *     [1] Some host boards generate the STEM_notCSx signals by sub-decoding an
 *         EMI bank based on the EMI address accessed (eg mb705 EPLD).  The
 *         stm_nand_emi driver accesses NAND via the EMI buffer and will
 *         therefore work as expected with sub-decoded EMI banks.  However, if
 *         using the NAND controller (ie stm_nand_flex or stm_nand_afm), the EMI
 *         buffer is bi-passed and the EMI address pads will remain high.
 *         Consequently, is it only possible to use the NAND controller if the
 *         decoding logic expects the address pads to be high when asserting the
 *         CS (typically the 'upper' sub-bank).
 *
 *     [2] The STEM2 interface now accepts the NAND ready/not-busy signal (eg
 *         mb837).  To support this option, while remaining backwards compatible
 *         with previous boards, we use STEM_NAND_RDY, defaulting to 0 if not
 *         defined.
 *
 *     [3] The mb588 board is a generic NAND STEM module and may be populated
 *         with any compatible NAND device.  The timing paramters specified
 *         below have been chosen to work with a large number of NAND devices.
 *         Considerable improvement in performance can be gained by tuning the
 *         parameters to the particular NAND device being used.
 *
 *     [4] Some additional host board setup may be required to use proper CS
 *         signal signal - see "arch/sh/include/mach-<board>/mach/stem.h" for
 *         more information.
