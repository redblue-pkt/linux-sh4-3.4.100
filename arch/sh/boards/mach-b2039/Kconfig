	  It is possible to use either MII or RMII to communicate with
	  the IC+101 Ethernet PHY mounted inside the STxH207. Use this
	  option to select the desired protocol. This must match the
	  jumper setting on the board:

	bool "Use PIO3[0] as a PHY reset signal"
	default y
	help
	  Set this option to use PIO3[0] as a PHY reset signal. This requires
	  fitting J35 in position 1-2 (which prevents the use of this pin
	  as SBC_SYS_CLK_IN), and also disconnecting CN12 (which prevents
	  the use of UART11). This also conflicts with the keyscan and
	  PWM10 use of this pin.

config STM_B2039_PIO15_AUDIO
	bool "Use PIO15[7:0] for PCM audio"
	default n
	help
	  Set this option to use PIO15 for audio purposes. This conflicts with
	  SSC3 and UART2.
	  The audio assignment for PIO15 is as follows:
	  - PIO15[3:0] Alt Fn 3 for PCM Player #2 (PIO)
	  - PIO15[7:4] Alt Fn 6 for PCM Reader
