	help
		Say Y here for ALSA support on the STMicroelectronics SoCs.

		This driver provides core functionality - you have to build
		(at least one) SoC-specific driver as well. Additionally, it is
		using dynamic device minor number allocation, so udev-like
		utility is required.

		It is recommended to have BPA2 enabled with dedicated
		partition defined, however it is not absolutely necessary.

		To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	 	will be called snd-stm.ko

		Define a name of BPA2 partition the driver should try to
		allocate from.

		If name is not given or given partition does not exist, driver
		will try to use "bigphysmem" partition or eventually
		preallocate some system memory using
		ALSA snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_pages_for_all() method.

		This value can be overridden by module parameter
		"bpa2_part=<name>" (or kernel command line parameter
		"snd-stm.bpa2_part=<name>", if driver is compiled into
		kernel).
