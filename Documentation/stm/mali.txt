What is mali?
=============

This is the kernel hardware driver for the ARM Mali400 GPU as integrated in
certain STMicroelectronics SoCs.

How to use it?
==============

The module registers a platform driver for the platform device named "mali". If
a "mali" platform device has been registered as part of the kernel board setup,
the module will be automatically loaded on boot. The module can also be loaded
and unloaded manually if required.

Once a device has been sucessfully probed the driver registers both a character
device and a class device; on a udev system a device file /dev/mali will be
automatically created with the correct major/minor device numbers. Note that
this is different to the stock ARM driver, which does not register a class
device and so does not work with udev.

Module Parameters
=================

The module supports the following module parameters:

mali_major := <major device number>

mali_debug_level := number

It is recommended that the major device number is left at the default value of
zero, which allows the driver to auto allocate the major number; on a standard
STLinux installation udev will create a device file for you using the auto
allocated number. However if you need to determine the major/minor number
pair for the device then this can be read from the sysfs attribute:

/sys/class/mali/mali/dev

The default debug level is "2", which if the driver is built with debug enabled
outputs some basic details on driver load and as applications open and close the
driver. Increasing the debug level will produce an increasing amount of trace in
dmesg and syslog.

Specifying Platform Device Resources
====================================

The module recognises the following named platform resources and resource types
from which the driver is configured:

MALI400GP:             IORESOURCE_MEM, IORESOURCE_IRQ
MALI400PP-0:           IORESOURCE_MEM, IORESOURCE_IRQ
MALI400PP-1:           IORESOURCE_MEM, IORESOURCE_IRQ
MMU-1:                 IORESOURCE_MEM, IORESOURCE_IRQ
MMU-2:                 IORESOURCE_MEM, IORESOURCE_IRQ
MMU-3:                 IORESOURCE_MEM, IORESOURCE_IRQ
MALI400L2:             IORESOURCE_MEM
OS_MEMORY:             IORESOURCE_DMA
MEMORY:                IORESOURCE_DMA
EXTERNAL_MEMORY_RANGE: IORESOURCE_DMA

The physical hardware register ranges and IRQs are fixed for a specific SoC and
will be provided to you by ST. However the memory resources need to be
configured for your board and system use case, potentially with the help of
your FAE or STSDK support contact.

Here is an example configuration for the HDK7108 (STx7108 based board) which is
in this case using a single memory interface with 128MB available.

static struct stm_mali_resource hdk7108_mali_mem[1] = {
	{
		.name 	= "OS_MEMORY",
		.start 	=  0,
		.end	=  CONFIG_STM_MALI_OS_MEMORY_SIZE - 1,
	},
};

static struct stm_mali_resource hdk7108_mali_ext_mem[] = {
	{
		.name 	= "EXTERNAL_MEMORY_RANGE",
		.start 	=  0x40000000,
		.end	=  0x4FFFFFFF,
	}
};

static struct stm_mali_config hdk7108_mali_config = {
	.num_mem_resources = ARRAY_SIZE(hdk7108_mali_mem),
	.mem = hdk7108_mali_mem,
	.num_ext_resources = ARRAY_SIZE(hdk7108_mali_ext_mem),
	.ext_mem = hdk7108_mali_ext_mem,
};

If this is placed in the kernel board setup ifile for the MB837 i.e. in:

arch/sh/boards/st/mb837/setup.c

then the mali device can be configured by simply calling

	stx7108_configure_mali(&hdk7108_mali_config);

in setup.c

This will register a "mali" platform device with the kernel, and also add SOC
specific resources to platform device.

A useful feature of the platform device system is that it does not matter in
which order the device and driver are registered with the kernel. So it is
perfectly OK to load the mali module, then subsequently load your own module
that contains the platform device registration.

Configuring Memory Allocators
=============================

The GPU potentially requires large amounts of memory for both internal use as
well as for textures, color buffers, depth buffers and anything else associated
with an EGL rendering context. The driver provides two memory allocators
which can be independently configured for this purpose.

The simplest is the "OS_MEMORY" allocator, as shown in the example above, which
allows the driver to allocate up to the specified size from the Linux kernel
memory system. There are pros and cons in using this as you are sharing memory
usage with the rest of Linux, including your applications, but it is a nice
and easy way of getting started.

The driver also has its own memory allocator, which can be registered to
manage a block of physical memory that Linux is either unaware of or has been
allocated from another large physically contiguous memory allocator such as
BPA2 or STAVMEM. This allocator can be registered multiple times using different
memory regions, allowing memory to be managed on different DDR interfaces for
example. This allocator is registered using the "MEMORY" resource, where
the "start" is the _physical_ address of the start of the memory region
to be used. Specifying multiple "MEMORY" resources will create multiple
allocators, clearly the memory regions used must not overlap with each other.

Other Memory
============

As well as allocating its own memory, the Mali driver can be configured to
allow it to access any other region of memory directly. This is used to
directly render to framebuffers or to directly access native pixmaps, given
suitable support in the EGL platform integration being used. This is done using
the "EXTERNAL_MEMORY_RANGE" resource, in the above example a range is specified
to cover the first 128MB of the first DDR interface. Note that there is
currently a limitation in the driver that only allows a single
EXTERNAL_MEMORY_RANGE resource to be specified.

It is recommended, to avoid mistakes that may lead to hard to find performance
issues, that all DDR is covered by this mechanism. Secure memory regions
should be protected from the GPU by hardware access mechanisms, rather than
excluding them from this mechanism. One reasonable exception to this could be
the memory reserved for ST231 co-processor firmwares.
