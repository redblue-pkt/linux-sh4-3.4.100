			STM device config
*******************************************************************************
device config takes care of configuring a particular set of sysconfs/clocks
during intialization or powerup or powerdown setups.

This is done in very like the old style.
Each driver takes a phandle via device-config property.


Required properties:
device-config:	phandles pointing at a device configuration node.
		These referenced dev configuration nodes must define
		list of sysconfs, clocks be configured.
		Format of these	configuration is detailed below.

For example:

	/* For a client device requiring named states */
	device {
		device-config	= <&miphy_dev_config>;
	};

Contents of device config node:
----------------------

Required properties:
- sysconfs: 	child node with list of sysconfs.
- device-seqs: node which contain list of named child nodes
		with sequences to be executed.
		Each sequence has to be specified as a step node,
		and each step has to contain a type property.

	-type: type property can take only types of clock, sysconf,
		and sysconf-feedback.



Typical sequence node looks like:

	xxx-seq{
		step0{
			val = <xyz>;
			type = "xxxx";
		};
		step1{
			...
		};
		...
	};

There are four different types of sequences are currently
supported in stm-device config.

1. power-on-seq: List of sequences from step0...stepN to power up the IP.
2. power-down-seq: List of sequences from step0...stepN to power down IP.
3. init-seq: List of sequences from step0...stepN while initializing the IP.
4. exit-seq: List of sequences from step0...stepN to be performed
		while exiting the driver.


sequence node of type == "clock" have the below bindings.
This sequence enables to set parent of a clock and also set rate for each of
them. By default this sequence enables the clock, you could change this
behaviour by adding clk-disable flag.

- clk-name		: Name of the clock to setup.
- clk-rate		: rate at which clk should be set.
- clk-disable		: boolean flag to indicate if the clock should be disabled.
- clk-parent-name	: parent clock name to be used as clk parent for "clk-name"
- clk-parent-rate	: parent clock rate.

example:

stm_sata0: sata@fe818000{
	compatible	= "st,sata", "simple-bus";
	reg		= <0xfe818000 0x1000>;
	interrupts	=  <0 161 0>, <0 162 0>;
	interrupt-names = "hostc", "dmac";
	status		= "disabled";

	device-config = <&sata0_dev_config>;
	amba-config = <&sata_amba_config>;

	st,oob_wa;
	st,port = <0>;
	stm.miphy = <0>;

	sata0_dev_config: sata0-dev-config {
		#stm-sysconf-cells = <4>;
		device-seqs = <&sata_dev_seqs>;
		sysconfs {
			SATA_ACK =	<&stih415_sysconf 384 3 3>;
			SATA_HC_PWR =	<&stih415_sysconf 336 3 3>;
		};
	};
};

sata_dev_seqs: sata-dev-seqs{
	power-on-seq{
		step0 {
			SATA_HC_PWR = <0>;
			type = "sysconf";
		};
		step1{
			SATA_ACK = <0>;
			type = "sysconf-feedback";
		};
	};
	power-off-seq{
		step0 {
			SATA_HC_PWR = <1>;
			type = "sysconf";
		};
		step1{
			SATA_ACK = <1>;
			type = "sysconf-feedback";
		};
	};
};
