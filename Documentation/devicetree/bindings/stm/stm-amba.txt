* stm amba bus config

Required properties:
- compatible : "amba-brige".
- reg, reg-names, interrupts, interrupt-names	: Standard way to define device resources with names.
look in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt

- reg-offset	Offset in IP mem base for ahb-bridge registers.

- bridge_type2	Bridge type New generation.
			else
			Bridge type Older version ADCS: 7526996 is selected

Type of transaction to generate on stbus side
- max_opcode_LD4_ST4
- max_opcode_LD8_ST8
- max_opcode_LD16_ST16
- max_opcode_LD32_ST32
- max_opcode_LD54_ST64

- chunks_in_msg	integer value Defines the maximum number of chunk an STBus
			message may be built of at any time stbus message.
- packets_in_chunk	integer value Defines the maximum number of chunk an STBus
			message may be built of at any time.

- write_posting	to enable write-posting.

Fields unique to v1
- req_timeout

Fields unique to v2
- sd_config_missing	some of the bridges do not have sd_config register.

- threshold		integer value specifies the minimum number of data bytes to be stored
			at consecutive addresses which must be available in the
			Request FIFO in order to start issuing an STBus burst.

- req_notify_cell_based	Specifies when an AHB transaction is to be started.
				(cell-based): The transaction is started as soon as one
				STBus cell is received
				if property is not specified it selects
				(burst-based): The transaction is started as soon as an
				AHB burst is ready in the Request FIFOs

- complete_on_error		Specifies what the behaviour the bridge has to be when an
				error response is encountered on the AHB side.
				The current transaction is carried on to its completion
				if property not specified, The current transaction is aborted.

- merge_msg			message merge feature enable/disable.

- cell_based_trigger	Specifies whether the generation of STBus transactions
				has to be cell-based.
				if the property is not specified, the trigger defaults to
				be threshold-based.


- read_ahead		read ahead feature enable/disable.

Example:

	ethernet-bus-config: stm-eth-amba-bridge {
		reg-offset		=	<0x1FFC>;
		bridge_type2;
		chunks_in_msg	=	<1>;
		packets_in_chunk	=	<2>;
		write_posting;
		max_opcode_LD64_ST64;
		threshold		=	<512>;
		sd_config_missing;
		read_ahead;
	};
