* STMicroElectronics Secure Digital Host Controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "st,sdhci"
- reg : Should contain SD/MMC registers location and length
- interrupts : Should contain SD/MMC interrupt

Optional properties:
- st,mmc-non-removable		Card is not removable i.e. eMMC
- st,mmc-core-init		To call the Arasan Core init and configure
				the host controller before accessing to its
				registers and configuring the driver to
				support one of the following SPEC:
					0: ARASAN_EMMC_4_5
					1: ARASAN_EMMC_4_3
					2: ARASAN_SD_3_0
					3: ARASAN_SD_2_0
- st,mmc-auto-tuning		To program HW like the DLL in Monaco and allow
				auto-tuning on super-speed selection.
- st,mmc-has-vsense		To switch among different voltages.

- st,no-hispd-bit		Do not have HISPD bit field in HI-SPEED SD card

Example:

sdhci@c8000200 {
	compatible = "st,sdhci";
	reg = <0xc8000200 0x200>;
	interrupts = <47>;
};
