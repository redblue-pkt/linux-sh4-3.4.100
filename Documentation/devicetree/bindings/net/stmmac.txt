* STMicroelectronics 10/100/1000 Ethernet driver (GMAC)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "snps,dwmac" or "st,spear600-gmac"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the STMMAC interrupts
- interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names "macirq"
  "eth_wake_irq" if this interrupt is supported in the "interrupts"
  property
- phy-mode: String, operation mode of the PHY interface.
  Supported values are: "mii", "rmii", "gmii", "rgmii".

Optional properties:
- mac-address		6 bytes, mac address
- phy-handle		Should be a phandle to the PHY.
- snps,clk-csr		Fixed CSR Clock range selection.
- snps,enh-desc		Boolean flag to indicate if mac support
			enhanced descriptors.
- snps,tx-coe		flag for Tx Checksum Offload engine presence
- snps,rx-coe		flag fo Rx Checksum Offload engine presence.
- snps,bugged-jumbo	some HWs are not able to perform the csum in HW for
			over-sized frames due to limited buffer sizes.
			Setting this flag the csum will be done in SW on
			JUMBO frames.
- snps,force-sf-dma-mode  force DMA to use the Store and Forward mode
			instead of the Threshold.
- snps,pbl		Programmable Burst Length
- snps,fixed-burst	Program the DMA to use the fixed burst mode
- snps,burst-len		This is the value we put in the register
			supported values are provided as macros in
			linux/stmmac.h header file.
- snps,phy-bus-name	Name of the mdio bus to connect. if not specified
			mac attempts to connect to stmmac mdio bus.
- snps,phy-bus-id	Mdio bus number to connect. if not specified 0 is used.
- snps,phy-addr		phy address to connect to.

- snps,reset-gpio 	gpio number for phy reset.
- snps,reset-active-low boolean flag to indicate if phy reset is active low.
- snps,reset-delays-us  is triplet of delays
	The 1st cell is reset pre-delay in micro seconds.
	The 2nd cell is reset pulse in micro seconds.
	The 3rd cell is reset post-delay in micro seconds.
- snps,bugged_sg	do not allow SG feature due to HW limits, e.g. bugged
			csum on fragments.
- snps,fixed-burst	Program the DMA to use the fixed burst mode
- snps,mixed-burst	Program the DMA to use the mixed burst mode
- snps,force_thresh_dma_mode	Force DMA to use the threshold mode for
				both tx and rx
- snps,force_sf_dma_mode	Force DMA to use the Store and Forward
				mode for both tx and rx. This flag is
				ignored if force_thresh_dma_mode is set.

Optional properties:
- mac-address: 6 bytes, mac address
>>>>>>> e2a240c... driver:net:stmmac: Disable DMA store and forward mode if platform data force_thresh_dma_mode is set.
