                STM NAND Support: FLEX, AFM, and BCH Drivers
===============================================================================

Required properties:

  - compatible          : Select according to STM NAND driver: "st,nand-afm",
                          "st,nand-bch", "st,nand-flex".

  - reg,                : Standard register descriptions for named resources:
  - reg-names,          :   "nand_mem" : NAND Controller register map
                            "nand_dma" : ["st,nand-bch ONLY"] BCH Controller DMA
                                           configuration map

  - interrupts,         : Standard description for named IRQ:
  - interrupt-names	:   "nand_irq" : NAND Controller IRQ

  - st,nand-banks       : Subnode representing one or more "banks" of NAND
                          Flash, connected to an STM NAND Controller (see
                          descriptin below).  Note, "st,nand-bch" only supports
                          a single connected NAND bank.

  - st,bch-ecc-mode     : ["st,nand-bch" ONLY] BCH ECC configuration mode:
                            "auto"  : Use strongest ECC supported by device
                            "noecc" : No ECC
                            "18bit" : Use 18-bit/1024B ECC
                            "30bit" : Use 30-bit/1024B ECC

  - st,bch-bitflip-threshold
                        : ["st,nand-bch" ONLY] The threshold at which the
                          number of corrected bit-flips per sector is deemed to
                          have reached an excessive level (triggers '-EUCLEAN'
                          to be returned to the caller).  The value should be
                          in the range 1 to <ecc-strength> where <ecc-strength>
                          is 18 or 30, depending on the BCH ECC mode in
                          operation.  A value of 0, or if left unspecified, is
                          interpreted by the driver as <ecc-strength>.

  - st,nand-flashss	: use flashSS sub-system instead of emiss (the default).

  - st,nand-timing-relax : [Optional] Number of IP clock cycles by which to
                          "relax" timing configuration.  Required on some boards
                          to accommodate board-level limitations. Applies to
                          'st,nand-timing-spec' and ONFI timing mode
                          configuration.

  - nand-on-flash-bbt   : [Optional] Generic NAND properties (See mtd/nand.txt
  - nand-no-autoinc     :   for more details).

  - partitions          : [Optional] Subnode describing MTD partition map
                          (see mtd/partition.txt for more details).

Note, during initialisation, the NAND Controller timing registers are configured
according to one of the following methods, in order of precedence:

           1. Configuration based on "st,nand_timing_spec" if supplied.

           2. Configuration based on "st,nand_timing_data" if supplied.  Not
              supported by the stm-nand-bch driver, and deprecated in favour of
              method 1.

           3. Configuration based on ONFI timing mode, as advertised by the
              device during ONFI-probing (ONFI-compliant NAND only).

           4. Use reset/safe timing values

Example 'stm-nand-afm' configuration:

	nandafm: nand-afm{
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		compatible	= "st,nand-afm", "simple-bus";
		reg =	<0xFE901000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "nand_mem";
		interrupts = <0 146 0x0>;
		interrupt-names = "nand_irq";
		status = "disabled";
		st,nand-banks = <&nand_banks>;
	};

	nand_banks: nand-banks {
		bank0 {
			/* NAND_BBT_USE_FLASH */
			nand-on-flash-bbt;
			nand-no-autoincr;
			st,nand-csn		= <0>;
			st,nand-timing-data	= <&nand_timing0>;
			partitions {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <1>;
				partition@0{
					label = "NAND Flash 1";
					reg = <0x00000000 0x00800000>;
				};
				partition@800000{
					label = "NAND Flash 2";
					reg = <0x00800000 0x0F800000>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

	nand_timing0: nand-timing {
		sig-setup	= <10>;
		sig-hold	= <10>;
		CE-deassert	= <0>;
		WE-to-RBn	= <100>;
		wr-on		= <10>;
		wr-off		= <30>;
		rd-on		= <10>;
		rd-off		= <30>;
		chip-delay	= <30>;		/* delay in us */
	};
