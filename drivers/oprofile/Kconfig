config PROFILING
	bool "Profiling support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the extended profiling support mechanisms used
	  by profilers such as OProfile.

config OPROFILE
	tristate "OProfile system profiling"
	depends on PROFILING
	depends on HAVE_OPROFILE
	select RING_BUFFER
	select RING_BUFFER_ALLOW_SWAP
	help
	  OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
	  whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
	  and applications.

	  If unsure, say N.

config OP_SH_USE_TMU
	bool "Sample using TMU2 timer"
	depends on CPU_SUBTYPE_ST40 && OPROFILE
	help
	  Uses the generic timer API to sample using the TMU2 timer
	  peripheral instead of the standard timer interrupt. This 
	  allows the user to vary the sample rate with opcontrol --rate.

config OPROFILE_IBS
	bool "OProfile AMD IBS support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default n
	depends on OPROFILE && SMP && X86
	help
          Instruction-Based Sampling (IBS) is a new profiling
          technique that provides rich, precise program performance
          information. IBS is introduced by AMD Family10h processors
          (AMD Opteron Quad-Core processor "Barcelona") to overcome
          the limitations of conventional performance counter
          sampling.

	  If unsure, say N.

config OPROFILE_EVENT_MULTIPLEX
	bool "OProfile multiplexing support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	default n
	depends on OPROFILE && X86
	help
	  The number of hardware counters is limited. The multiplexing
	  feature enables OProfile to gather more events than counters
	  are provided by the hardware. This is realized by switching
	  between events at an user specified time interval.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HAVE_OPROFILE
	bool
